<h3><a name="status">Status of this document</a></h3>

This document represents a consensus on 30 June 1994 on the robots
mailing list (robots-request@nexor.co.uk), between the majority of
robot authors and other people with an interest in robots. It has also
been open for discussion on the Technical World Wide Web mailing list
(www-talk@info.cern.ch). This document is based on a previous working
draft under the same title.

<p>

It is not an official standard backed by a standards body,
or owned by any commercial organisation.

It is not enforced by anybody, and there no guarantee that
all current and future robots will use it.

Consider it a common facility the majority of robot authors
offer the WWW community to protect WWW server against
unwanted accesses by their robots.</p>

<p>

<h3><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h3>

WWW Robots (also called wanderers or spiders) are programs
that traverse many pages in the World Wide Web by
recursively retrieving linked pages. For more information
see <a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/">the robots page</a>.

<p>

In 1993 and 1994 there have been occasions where robots
have visited WWW servers where they weren't welcome for
various reasons. Sometimes these reasons were robot specific,
e.g. certain robots swamped servers with rapid-fire
requests, or retrieved the same files repeatedly.
In other situations robots traversed parts of WWW servers
that weren't suitable, e.g. very deep virtual trees,
duplicated information, temporary information, or
cgi-scripts with side-effects (such as voting).</p>

<p>

These incidents indicated the need for established
mechanisms for WWW servers to indicate to robots which parts
of their server should not be accessed. This standard
addresses this need with an operational solution.</p>

<h3><a name="method">The Method</a></h3>

The method used to exclude robots from a server is to
create a file on the server which specifies an access
policy for robots.

This file must be accessible via HTTP on the local URL
"<code>/robots.txt</code>".
The contents of this file are specified <a href="#format">below</a>.

<p>

This approach was chosen because it can be easily
implemented on any existing WWW server, and a robot can find
the access policy with only a single document retrieval.</p>

<p>

A possible drawback of this single-file approach is that only a
server administrator can maintain such a list, not the
individual document maintainers on the server. This can be
resolved by a local process to construct the single file
from a number of others, but if, or how, this is done is
outside of the scope of this document.</p>

<p>

The choice of the URL was motivated by several criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>

The filename should fit in file naming restrictions of all
common operating systems.

<li>

The filename extension should not require extra server
configuration.

<li>

The filename should indicate the purpose of the file
and be easy to remember.

<li>

The likelihood of a clash with existing files should
be minimal.

</ul>

<h3><a name="format">The Format</a></h3>

The format and semantics of the "<code>/robots.txt</code>" file
are as follows:

<p>

The file consists of one or more records separated by one or
more blank lines (terminated by CR,CR/NL, or NL). Each
record contains lines of the form
"<code>&lt;field&gt;:&lt;optionalspace&gt;&lt;value&gt;&lt;optionalspace&gt;</code>".
The field name is case insensitive.</p>

<p>

Comments can be included in file using UNIX bourne shell
conventions: the '<code>#</code>' character is used to
indicate that preceding space (if any) and the remainder of
the line up to the line termination is discarded.
Lines containing only a comment are discarded completely,
and therefore do not indicate a record boundary.</p>

<p>
The record starts with one or more <code>User-agent</code>
lines, followed by one or more <code>Disallow</code> lines,
as detailed below. Unrecognised headers are ignored.</p>

<dl>
<dt>User-agent</dt>
<dd>

The value of this field is the name of the robot the
record is describing access policy for.

<p>
If more than one User-agent field is present the record
describes an identical access policy for more
than one robot. At least one field needs to be present
per record.</p>

<p>
The robot should be liberal in interpreting this field.
A case insensitive substring match of the name without
version information is recommended.</p>

<p>

If the value is '<code>*</code>', the record describes
the default access policy for any robot that has not
matched any of the other records. It is not allowed to
have multiple such records in the "<code>/robots.txt</code>"
file.</p></dd>

<dt>Disallow</dt>
<dd>

The value of this field specifies a partial URL that is not
to be visited. This can be a full path, or a partial
path; any URL that starts with this value will not be
retrieved. For example, <code>Disallow: /help</code>
disallows both <code>/help.html</code> and
<code>/help/index.html</code>, whereas
<code>Disallow: /help/</code> would disallow
<code>/help/index.html</code>
but allow <code>/help.html</code>.

<p>

Any empty value, indicates that all URLs can be
retrieved. At least one Disallow field needs to
be present in a record.</p></dd>

</dl>

The presence of an empty "<code>/robots.txt</code>" file
has no explicit associated semantics, it will be treated
as if it was not present, i.e. all robots will consider
themselves welcome.

<h3><a name="examples">Examples</a></h3>

The following example "<code>/robots.txt</code>" file specifies
that no robots should visit any URL starting with
"<code>/cyberworld/map/</code>" or
"<code>/tmp/</code>", or <code>/foo.html</code>:

<pre>
# robots.txt for http://www.example.com/

User-agent: *
Disallow: /cyberworld/map/ # This is an infinite virtual URL space
Disallow: /tmp/ # these will soon disappear
Disallow: /foo.html
</pre>

This example "<code>/robots.txt</code>" file specifies
that no robots should visit any URL starting with
"<code>/cyberworld/map/</code>", except the robot called
"<code>cybermapper</code>":

<pre>
# robots.txt for http://www.example.com/

User-agent: *
Disallow: /cyberworld/map/ # This is an infinite virtual URL space

# Cybermapper knows where to go.
User-agent: cybermapper
Disallow:
</pre>

This example indicates that no robots should visit
this site further:

<pre>
# go away
User-agent: *
Disallow: /
</pre>

<h3><a name="code">Example Code</a></h3>

Although it is not part of this specification, some example code
in Perl is available in norobots.pl.  It
is a bit more flexible in its parsing than this document
specificies, and is provided as-is, without warranty.

<p>

<blockquote>
<strong>Note:</strong>
This code is no longer available. 
Instead I recommend using the robots exclusion code
in the Perl libwww-perl5 library, available from
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a> in the
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/LWP/">LWP directory</a>.
