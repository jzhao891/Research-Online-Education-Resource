    <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
      <p>Many museums have large collections that far exceed
        available display space. These institutions face a significant challenge in
        making collections accessible to researchers and the general public. In addition
        to digitization, they must find and deploy Web-based tools that support search,
        discovery, and understanding of their collections. One common approach
        replicates the exhibition experience on-line; these sites are often beautifully
        authored but are not well-suited to the tasks faced by researchers or even by
      many public visitors. </p>
      <p>In contrast, many commercial enterprises are deploying
        state-of-the-art information management technologies that support search and
        discovery within their rapidly expanding document corpora. These approaches are
        often described as semantic search because they go beyond simple keyword
        matches and model semantics (meaning) in the collection using a combination of
        ontologies (knowledge models) and linguistic techniques. Given the size of
        these corpora, it would be impractical for humans to classify every document,
        especially since the &lsquo;appropriate&rsquo; categories may change depending on the
        audience. Semantic search tools address this by automatically associating
        concepts to each object. Enterprises have demonstrated the utility of these
        tools in making &lsquo;knowledge workers&rsquo; more productive.  This is driving rapid
      growth in the associated enterprise search market.</p>
      <p>While the activities of commercial enterprises are often
        quite different from those of museums, many information access tasks are
        actually quite similar. Dedicated staff use various metadata to search for
        particular items in a collection; visitors and general users need to understand
        what is available and how concepts are distributed across the collection;
        researchers seek to discover patterns and other knowledge within the
        collection. Semantic technologies support these activities particularly well,
        moving beyond the hit-or-miss success of keyword-based approaches and
        cumbersome, structured database search solutions to more powerful and
      easier-to-use tools for browsing and searching collections. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, these tools have not been adopted into the
        museum and cultural heritage sector due to a variety of factors, but primarily
      because:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Technical talent required to develop and deploy these solutions is
          somewhat scarce, and most of those with the appropriate background have been
        snapped up by commercial vendors of enterprise search tools.</li>
      <li>The underlying technologies (especially for natural language processing)
        are optimized for standard text document corpora. These linguistic tools tend
        to behave poorly when applied to the terse and jargon-laden language commonly
        used for annotations in collections management databases.</li>
      <li>Adapting the existing tools is a difficult and costly endeavor for
        museums, and is generally well beyond their sphere of expertise. By the same
        token, the cultural heritage sector is not seen by commercial vendors of
        enterprise search tools as sufficiently lucrative to justify adaptation of
        their existing tools.</li>
    </ol>
      <p>We have seen progress in related open source projects (e.g.,
        Fedora, OpenCollection, steve.museum, et al.), but no semantic toolkits are
        available for museums. Even if natural language processing (NLP) technology
        were more widely available, it would have to be adapted to meet the needs and
        goals of museums. In addition, activity around &lsquo; 2.0&rsquo; and  emphasis on
        community is pushing museum sites to move beyond the typical on-line exhibit
        model and to provide collections explorers with support for personalization and
      sharing.</p>
      <p>Recognizing these problems and having a strong interest in
        the cultural heritage sector, a group of graduate students at the U.C. Berkeley
        School of Information created Delphi &ndash; an open source toolkit that
        combines state of the art tools for NLP and ontology-based faceted browsing,
        together with ideas from social media sites (e.g., Flickr, Digg, et al.). The
        toolkit was developed in close collaboration with staff at the Phoebe A. Hearst
        Museum of Anthropology (PAHMA) at U.C. Berkeley, and was deployed for the
        Museum&rsquo;s collections. After a period of staff review and additional usability
        testing, the associated  site was updated and launched in early 2008. Delphi is
        freely available under open source license, and we hope to build a community of
      museums and technologists that will facilitate its wider deployment. </p>
      <p>The next sections provide some background and context for
        the development project, an overview of the Delphi toolkit and technologies, and
        our deployment experience with the PAHMA collections. We close with a
        discussion of ongoing and future work around Delphi and the PAHMA collections
      browser.</p>
      <h1>2. Background And Related Work</h1>
      <h2>2.1. Museums Context</h2>
      <p>In an era that has witnessed calls for the increased
        transparency of, and more freely available information from, cultural heritage
        museums, such museums have increasingly come to regard on-line collections
      accessibility as one means of making substantial progress towards these goals.</p>
      <p>For museums wishing to let the on-line public explore their
        collections, however, the avenues towards this goal, as well as the tools
        needed to implement them, are limited. One common approach used is to create
        on-line exhibitions - a task for which many tools exist, notably the open
        source toolkits created by the Omeka (<a href="http://omeka.org/">http://omeka.org</a>) and Pachyderm (<a href="http://pachyderm.org/">http://pachyderm.org</a>)
        projects.  In fact, many museums depend exclusively on on-line exhibits as a
        means of exposing their collections to an on-line audience (e.g., National
      Museum of the American Indian, <a href="http://www.nmai.si.edu/">http://www.nmai.si.edu</a>).</p>
      <p>While the didactic and aesthetic value of these on-line
        galleries argues for their being an important element of the museum&rsquo;s
        educational mission, the experience of a narrated, linear progression through a
        series of carefully selected objects that such on-line exhibits offer is no
        substitute for an individual&rsquo;s untethered, self-guided exploration and
        discovery of a museum&rsquo;s collections. Such on-line exhibitions do not give the
        users the freedom to explore museum objects in ways that make the most sense to
        them, nor do these sites fulfill the aims of curiosity, research, or casual
      interest that brought them to the museum&rsquo;s site in the first place.</p>
      <p>Two current options available to museums are  publishing
        tools that integrate with a museum&rsquo;s existing CMS (e.g., eMuseum paired with
        TMS, both by Gallery Systems), or stand-alone content management systems that
        allow visitors to query catalogued metadata to find information and images of
        interest. Such on-line collections databases represent a large step towards the
        goal of accessibility, but they still leave a lot to be desired for a
        non-specialist target audience because searching is almost always based on
      simplistic keyword- and field-based queries.</p>
      <p>Both of these options suffer from many of the same problems
        that internal cultural museum databases suffer from.  These systems, commonly
        based on direct transcription of historical paper records, force the
        unsuspecting public to read the minds of the last two hundred years of anthropologists
        and force users to follow antiquated classification systems.  For searches in
        such a system to return meaningful, accurate, and reasonably comprehensive
        results, the users must know what they want to find and how to go about finding
        it. This is more complex than it sounds, and the quality of the results
        obtained depends on several factors. The role of these factors is best
      illustrated with examples.</p>
      <p>Best search results often rely on knowledge of how experts
        in the field refer to, and have historically referred to, the object or subject
        in question.  For example, someone looking for an example of a Papago basket
        similar to the one their grandfather had collected would need to know that the
        term &lsquo;Papago&rsquo; has now been largely replaced by the term &lsquo;Tohono O&rsquo;odham,&rsquo; and
        so queries will need to be run on both terms. In addition to such simple term
        substitutions, the user must speculate as to how objects with specific names in
        one field may have been catalogued by experts (or even non-experts) in related
        fields.  For instance, a type of object commonly sought at PAHMA is referred to
        as a &lsquo;donut stone.&rsquo;  While much of the collections at PAHMA were catalogued and
        documented by experts, terminology varied according to the research perspective
        of the cataloguer. In order to find these &lsquo;donut stones,&rsquo; a user would need to
        search for &lsquo;stone&rsquo; and/or &lsquo;rock&rsquo; in association with &lsquo;round,&rsquo; &lsquo;hole,&rsquo;&rsquo;&ldquo;perforated,&rsquo;
      &lsquo;net weight,&rsquo; &lsquo;digging stone,&rsquo; or &lsquo;charmstone&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>Another problem is that simple keyword-based searches often work
        quite poorly. For instance, a user wishing to find examples of plates (for
        food) might search on &lsquo;plate&rsquo; and be surprised to find silver plated objects,
        printing plates, plates of engravings, fashion plates, plate armor, plate
        racks, photographic plates, as well as plates meant for food.  In fact, a
        search for &lsquo;plate&rsquo; at one cultural museums site with 82,000 searchable objects
      returned 7,470 results, nearly 10% of their total collections.</p>
      <p>Most of these issues can also be addressed with extensive
        data cleaning, normalization, etc.  This may be viable for an on-line
        exhibition with a few hundred objects, but scaling this to every item in a
        museum with tens or hundreds of thousands of objects would entail years-long
      delay in making collections accessible to the public. </p>
      <p>Another consideration relates to the changing focus of
        scientific research at museums from traditional descriptive endeavors to more
        synthetic and integrative research avenues.  This shift is resulting in greater
        numbers of researchers bringing broad and seemingly vague requests to museums:
        prospective researchers might &ldquo;want to compare objects made of hard woods to
        those made from softer wood&rdquo; or &ldquo;want to look at depictions of children through
      human history.&rdquo; </p>
      <p>A few cultural heritage institutions are exploring newer
        technologies for on-line collections browsing. Most notable among these recent
        offerings is the Smithsonian&rsquo;s SIRIS project (<a href="http://siris-collections.si.edu/search">http://siris-collections.si.edu/search</a>),
        which incorporates a faceted browser to facilitate navigation and discovery of
        the contributing institutions&rsquo; collections. SIRIS is still evolving to address
        usability issues and improve the user experience, and it should be noted that
      it is not an open source project nor otherwise available for wider use.</p>
      <h2>2.2. Academic And Enterprise Context</h2>
      <p>The Flamenco project (Yee et al., 2003) described a faceted
        browsing solution for image collections, and included tools to help extract the
        facet metadata that underlies the UI. We built upon many of the ideas in
        Flamenco, although we took a somewhat different approach to defining the
        ontology. In particular, many of the concepts were either fairly specific to
        the domain (e.g., specific types of baskets, types of ancient coins, and names
        of Native American tribes), or so general as to defy simple word labels (e.g.,
        figurative designs featuring a flower). Because of this, we were not at all
      confident that WordNet or other thesaurus resources would be very useful.</p>
      <p>Many commercial sites (e.g., Buy.com, Cnet.com) have begun
        to feature simple faceted browsers, further demonstrating their utility for
        search and discovery. However, most commerce sites have only a single, flat
        list of choices within each facet (this has also been called &ldquo;parameterized
        search&rdquo;). In part this is because their &lsquo;collection&rsquo; consists of at most
        hundreds or a few thousand objects. To cover the breadth and depth of PAHMA&rsquo;s
        millions of objects, we needed a more complex ontology, and more sophisticated
      support in the faceted browser.</p>
      <p>Many commercial vendors of enterprise search tools (e.g.,
        Autonomy/Verity, Convera, FAST, et al) leverage statistical and NLP tools, and
        support faceted browsing or similar semantic search UI. Many of these vendors
        provide much more sophisticated technology for question answering as well as
        support for enterprise document management, most of which is out of the scope
        of a museum collection&rsquo;s browser solution. As mentioned above, these tools are
        expensive and otherwise unsuited for this application, but the general approach
      served as inspiration for the Delphi toolkit. </p>
      <p>There are a number of open source NLP toolkits available
        (e.g., OpenNLP, NLTK), but like the enterprise tools, these concentrate on
        complex parsing of standard business text and machine learning techniques
        appropriate to large text corpora. A museum&rsquo;s application called for something
        lightweight and adapted to the linguistic constraints of collections
      annotations, with the tools to support faceted browsing.</p>
      <p>The OpenCollection project (<a href="http://www.opencollection.org/">http://www.opencollection.org</a>) provides
        a -based interface for collections management, but does not currently support
        browser functionality well-suited to the visiting public. In this sense, Delphi
        is a natural complement to OpenCollection, and we are considering a closer
      integration of the projects.</p>
      <h2>2.3. Social Media Tools</h2>
      <p>Social media tools have been shown to be very effective for
        generating and supporting the community around a media collection. The rapid
        growth of social media tools like Flickr (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/">http://www.flickr.com</a>)
        and del.icio.us (<a href="http://del.icio.us/">http://del.icio.us</a>) demonstrate the broad interest in these models, and some
        museums have already begun to leverage similar ideas. Libraries and Archives
        Canada (Greenhorn, 2005) has seen good success with this approach, and the
        Library of Congress recently began an experiment placing images from their
      collection on Flickr to generate annotations (Raymond, 2008). </p>
      <p>The most successful social media models focus not on media
        but on community, and how people want to use, reuse, and share media. While the
        steve.museum project provides open source support for tagging, it has not
        emphasized the sharing and community features that have made Flickr so successful.
        Research at Yahoo! (Shaw &amp; Schmitz, 2006) described the value of a research
        framework for community annotation of media to support analysis of annotation
      activity. Unfortunately, this is not available as an open source toolset.</p>
      <h1>3. Our Solution</h1>
      <p>Delphi is an on-line browsing and searching system that can
        be used by researchers, students, and educators to explore diverse museum
        collections. The interface helps a user discover and understand &ldquo;what&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;
        Delphi&rsquo;s features support searching, browsing, viewing information about
        objects, creating and viewing sets of objects, and annotating objects in the
      collections. </p>
      <p class="caption"><a name="fig1" id="fig1"></a><a href="schmitz-fig1.html"><img src="schmitz_Figure1-small.jpg" alt="Figure 1" width="400" height="403" /></a></p>
      <p class="caption"><a href="schmitz-fig1.html">Fig 1: The Delphi faceted browser</a></p>
      <p>The Delphi faceted browser provides a simple way to navigate
        through museum collections (Figure 1). The browser view changes dynamically to
        show only categories relevant to the area of the collection that is being
        explored. This makes the browsing experience more visually streamlined and
        helps the visitor discover categories and relationships between objects that
        may not otherwise be obvious. Clicking on any category <i>refines</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> the search. The category listing on the left is
          derived automatically from an underlying ontology</span><i> </i><span
style='font-style:normal'>that organizes concepts associated with the
            collections into distinct facets such as location, culture, materials, etc.
            Concepts are associated to each object in the collections by </span><i>text mining
              - </i><span style='font-style:normal'>applying linguistic tools to text
      metadata from an existing content management system.</span></p>
      <h2>3.1 Delphi Toolkit Overview</h2>
      <p>The Delphi toolkit provides: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>a suite of text analysis and processing tools that support development
        of ontologies and perform text mining, </li>
      <li> a data model and associated services to support collections browsing,
        and </li>
      <li>a presentation architecture that is easily customized to match the style
        and layout of a given institution&rsquo;s site.</li>
    </ol>
      <p>At the heart of the toolkit are the tools for text analysis
        and processing. These read in existing metadata (i.e., text fields associated
        with the objects in the collections) and analyze the vocabulary in use as a
        guide to the design of ontologies. Once an ontology is defined, additional
        linguistic tools process the metadata to <i>mine</i><span style='font-style:
normal'> concepts from the text, associating categories in the ontology with
          each object in the collections. The tools also use the knowledge models in the
          ontology to </span><i>infer </i><span style='font-style:normal'>additional concepts.
            The results are stored in a database and are used to support search and
      exploration tools in a  browser. </span></p>
      <h2>3.2 Analysis And Vocabulary Tools</h2>
      <p>A typical deployment will begin by using statistical
        analysis tools that describe the common vocabulary used in the metadata for a
        collection. The metadata itself are read from a simple text file, as comma- or
        tab-separated values that correspond to selected columns in the tables of a
        collection management system. These could also be selected columns from a
        spreadsheet or other simple tool that collects names, notes, descriptions and
        other data about each object in the collection. The contents of the file are
        fairly arbitrary - any column that has data useful for exploring or browsing
        the collection can be included. This &lsquo;dump file&rsquo; is easily exported from a
        variety of tools. This approach allows Delphi to work with a wide range of
      collection database solutions.</p>
      <p>A column configuration file is created to describe the
        contents of the dump file. This simple XML file specifies the name of each
        column and some basic rules about how to interpret the column text. An
        important class of rules defines characters and strings that separate
        meaningful tokens in the text (commonly semi-colons, periods, etc.). The Delphi
        tools first scan the column configuration file, and then use the rules to
      import the metadata dump file.</p>
      <p>Having imported the dump file and parsed the contents into
        tokens for each column, a useful function generates a report of the vocabulary
        used in each column, sorted in descending order of usage. This effectively identifies
        the key concepts that are used to describe objects, and so provides an
        indication of what concepts should be present in the ontology used to browse
      the collections.</p>
      <h3>3.2.1 Defining The Faceted Ontology</h3>
      <p>In some cases, existing common ontologies (or taxonomies or
        controlled vocabularies) may be leveraged for some facets (e.g, culture,
        location). However, depending on the collection, existing resources may have to
        be extended to reflect the vocabulary used by the museum (e.g., the place names
        referred to in a provenience column). In addition, since the ontology is used
        to derive the faceted browser UI, the structure and concept labels (aka primary
        terms) should be chosen with the end-user of the system in mind. An ontology
        (such as Getty&rsquo;s AAT) appropriate for museum staff may be much less useful or
        meaningful to visitors. This issue of point-of-view in ontology has broader
        implications that are discussed in some detail in the full deployment report
      (Amuzinskaya et al., 2007).</p>
      <p>The facets in an ontology are distinct and independent
        qualities.  Separating these from one another simplifies the overall structure
        and makes it easier and more powerful to use for searching and browsing.
        Following classic principles of faceted design (Ranganathan, 1945; Soergel, 1974),
        the PAHMA team chose facets that address the general questions of &lsquo;who?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what?&rsquo;,
      &lsquo;where?&rsquo;, &lsquo;when?&rsquo;, &lsquo;how?&rsquo; and &lsquo;why?&rsquo; for museum objects. </p>
      <p>An important step in the development of the ontology is the
        addition of linguistic features including synonyms (equivalent terms), and
        exclusions (terms that help disambiguate different meanings). This aspect of
        the ontology is a significant determinant in the overall quality of the search
        and browse experience, and thus is worth the required effort. In practice,
        however, it is an ongoing process that continually improves the results. The
      ontology is described in a simple XML format.</p>
      <h2>3.3 Text Mining And Inference Engine</h2>
      <p>The Delphi text mining tool uses an ontology and the
        metadata dump file to perform the text mining step (also known as <i>categorization</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> or </span><i>semantic indexing</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> in some enterprise search tools). The tool processes
          objects one at a time, filtering &lsquo;noise&rsquo; out of the text and then checking for
          the various terms associated to concepts in the ontology. Although the details
          are more complex, it is essentially an elaborate exercise in matching text
          strings and then checking for constraints to disambiguate among multiple
      meanings.</span></p>
      <p>A common problem encountered in text mining is that a given
        word can be used in various contexts. It may have multiple meanings, as in the
        case of &ldquo;jaguar&rdquo;: it can be an automobile, an animal, or a computer operating
        system. Words may also have the same meaning but be used in different ways. For
        example, the word &ldquo;deer&rdquo; is primarily used to denote a particular mammal.
        However, the PAHMA collection has many objects that are deer bones, and others
        that feature a representation of a deer as a design or motif. The PAHMA
        ontology has one facet for materials and another facet that includes designs.
        We want to recognize the design context without getting the deer bone objects
        mixed in. To achieve this, we use the idea of entailment phrases, such as &ldquo;figure
        of an X&rdquo; or &ldquo;X motif&rdquo; as a means of recognizing the sense we are interested in,
        and then apply these to an entire group of concepts. This makes it much easier
        to describe and maintain the ontology, but yields a very rich set of synonyms
      and improves the quality of the search results.</p>
      <p>Another feature of the ontology is support for inference
        rules that model knowledge about the domain (e.g., about anthropology in the
        PAHMA deployment). A simple case involves inferring broader categories from
        narrower ones found in the collections&rsquo; metadata (e.g., associating <i>Africa</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> with objects that come from </span><i>Ghana</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>). However, we can also incorporate domain knowledge
          into the ontology. As an example, for all objects that are a kind of </span><i>mask</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> and that are made of </span><i>wood</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, we can infer with reasonable confidence that the </span><i>technique</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> used to produce the objects was </span><i>carving</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>. It is common for annotators to omit common-sense
            details like this, but the omissions make it harder for users to find items by
            different criteria (in this case, by technique). Inference rules can greatly
            enrich the existing metadata and improve the search experience. The inference
            rules can be time-consuming to create, but can be added over time to improve
      the results. </span></p>
      <h2>3.4 Faceted Browsing Support</h2>
      <p>Each time a user clicks on a category to further refine a
        query, the service must translate the list of categories (plus any keywords
        from the initial search) into an efficient SQL query. For many categories, this
        becomes a deeply nested query that can be time-consuming for the database
        engine to compute. We developed a method of re-ordering the categories in such as
        way as to optimize the query process: this significantly improved performance
      (reducing page response times by a factor of five to ten).</p>
      <p>Once a set of results has been produced for the current
        query, additional database queries determine which categories are associated
        with the current results set. However, this set of categories often numbers in
        the hundreds. Delphi then applies heuristics to filter the categories for each
        facet down to a short list that summarizes the results and that also provides optimal
        refinement choices. This process must also ensure that the user is given
        sufficient context to understand the categories. For example, if all the
        results happen to come from within one area, we could just list the different
        cities for the set. But city names are far from unique, and may also be
        unfamiliar to some users. Without the state name (in the U.S.) or the country
        name (for other countries), users lack sufficient context to understand the
        categories. On the other hand, users do <i>not</i><span style='font-style:normal'> need to see </span><i>North America, United States, </i><span style='font-style:
normal'>or </span><i>Western Region</i><span style='font-style:normal'> as
          context for </span><i>California</i><span style='font-style:normal'>. Including
      these additional categories would clutter the user interface. </span></p>
      <h2>3.5 Social Media Support</h2>
      <p>We conducted an in-depth needs assessment of the
        functionality around media sharing and personalization. The resulting design
        allows users to gather items from the collection into personal sets around a
        given theme. Users can name each set, and then also add a note for each item,
        describing why it is in the set, creating narratives around their interests.
        They can then share these sets with others via an e-mail form, thereby drawing
      others to the museum. </p>
      <p>We have added simple tagging support, and continue to
        explore how best to integrate this with the existing semantic index on the
        collection. An open question remains as to whether users prefer tags to behave
        like additional keywords in a unified search model, or whether they want tags
        to function as a separate mechanism.  Another issue is whether users would want
        to leverage tags from the whole community or just use their own tags when
      searching. </p>
      <h2>3.6 Media Processing And Handling</h2>
      <p>We wanted to support detailed visual exploration of
        collection objects, but the Museum also wanted to protect the intellectual
        property rights to their high-resolution photos. Our solution was to convert
        the high-resolution images to tiles that support a zoom-and-pan applet on a
        details page for the object. This makes it very difficult to &lsquo;steal&rsquo; the
        high-resolution photos, but still provides detailed views. The initial version
        of Delphi uses off-the-shelf solutions to produce tile- and thumbnail-image
        derivatives, but this will likely be replaced by an open source variant such as
      that in OpenCollection. </p>
      <p>Although many users will focus on objects with images,
        nothing in the system depends on having images. The majority of the PAHMA
        collections have no images associated with the objects, but the browsing and
        back-end functionality works equally well, allowing researchers and others to
      discover and appreciate the full extent of the collections.</p>
      <h2>3.7 Web Presentation Layer And Templates</h2>
      <p>Delphi defines a simple presentation data model and a set of
        customizable HTML templates for generating the  page content. These templates
        (and associated CSS stylesheets) define the presentation and visual design,
        separated from the logic of how to get the information for the faceted browser,
        the object details, etc. This makes it very easy to adapt the visual design to
        fit the &lsquo;branding&rsquo; for a given institution, including logo graphics, general
        layout, color and font schemes, etc. Between the alpha and beta versions, PAHMA&rsquo;s
        Delphi site underwent a significant visual redesign simply by changing the
      templates, stylesheets, and some images.</p>
      <h1>4. Deployment Experience At PAHMA</h1>
      <p>The PAHMA deployment of Delphi was targeted at a broad
        audience of users with the aim of raising public awareness of the Museum and
        the depth and breadth of its collections. It was hoped that the Delphi browser
        would improve access to the Museum&rsquo;s collections for many different types of
        users: curators, collections managers, researchers, university students, K&#8211;12
        students, teachers, avocational &lsquo;hobbyists&rsquo;, history buffs, casual Internet
        browsers, potential Museum visitors, and heritage communities were among those
        who stood to benefit from the addition of the Delphi browser to the Museum&rsquo;s 
      presence.</p>
      <p>Museum staff hoped to serve all of these audiences equally
        well, but such a broad mandate was understood to be an unrealistic goal for the
        initial deployment of the Delphi browser.  The Delphi team undertook an
        extensive needs assessment to identify the primary audience to target in the
        initial deployment. Over the course of several months, numerous interviews were
        conducted with Museum staff, university faculty and students, K&#8211;12
        educators, visitors to the Museum, researchers visiting the collections, as
        well as members of the Berkeley community, some of whom were unaware of the
      Museum and its collections.</p>
      <p>Following the tenets of the User-Centered Design (UCD)
        philosophy, personae were defined to represent sample members of each target
      audience, and a task analysis matrix was compiled for each of these personae.</p>
      <p>The results of these analyses demonstrated that there were
        considerable areas of overlap among the various target audiences - overlap that
        could be optimized with a strategic choice of target audience.  This finding,
        paired with the Museum&rsquo;s stated goal of raising public awareness of the Museum
        and its collections, led to the selection of &ldquo;enthusiastic public visitors&rdquo; as the
        primary target audience.  Given the overlap in requirements and preferences,
        much of what was designed to best serve the primary target audience would also
        end up serving the other audiences.  In this sense, the primary target audience
        was not the sole audience for which the PAHMA deployment of Delphi was
        designed.  Rather, the deployment was intended to serve many, if not all, of
        these audiences.  Where serving multiple audiences created design conflicts,
      the needs of the primary target audience drove the final decision.</p>
      <p>The User-Centered Design process guided both the information
        architecture and the visual design of the Delphi collections browser.  For
        instance, to present a friendly and inviting interface, the front page features
        items and sets that beckon exploration.  To avoid overwhelming the beginning
        user, the faceted browser is initially hidden, and exploration of the
        collections begins with a simple and familiar search box.  This simplified
        search model then leads the user to an initial results page where the faceted
      browser is revealed. </p>
      <p>These and other design choices were made to best align the
        initial PAHMA deployment to its primary target audience, but Delphi can be
        configured to model many different classes of users, each coming to Delphi with
        a specific point of view, special requirements, and certain limitations.  Most
        users will see the default view, but qualified users can be presented with
        alternate views, varying the user interface, the facets chosen, access to
        different or additional types of data, as well as different levels of
        administrative or editorial access. For instance, an object&rsquo;s catalog number
        was argued to have little value to casual browsers and thus was hidden in the
        default view.  The same number is critically important to curators, collections
      managers, and researchers, and therefore is visible to them.</p>
      <p>An open question of considerable concern to PAHMA staff is
        the potential for rapid increase in researcher activity and requests to examine
        the original objects.  The Museum decided to accept that risk, given the
      potential benefits.</p>
      <p>One final consideration for any museum planning to expose
        its full collections metadata to a broad audience is that increased visibility
        brings with it potentially increased scrutiny, thus requiring increased efforts
        to review collections metadata for potentially embarrassing or sensitive
      content.</p>
      <h1>5. Future Work</h1>
      <h2>5.1. Planned New Features</h2>
      <p>We are continuing to improve and refine the text-mining
        engine to better recognize concepts and to support finer-grained relevancy
        ranking of the category associations. Other features we want to explore include
        automatic recognition of likely misspellings, and co-occurrence modeling to
        recognize alternate terms for a given concept and to suggest potential inference
      rules. </p>
      <p>As we refine the heuristics that filter categories to
        produce the faceted browser for a set of results, we have identified several
        concepts that we want to introduce into the ontology to improve the user
      experience. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>First is the notion of the <i>generic</i><span style='font-style:normal'> concept, i.e., one that is widely understood on its own, without qualification
          or context. For example, for a location facet, the level of U.S. state names (</span><i>California</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, </span><i>Michigan</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,
            etc.) needs no further context for most of the primary audience. Below this
            level are counties, cities and more detailed locations that require the generic
        context in order to be widely understood. </span></li>
      <li>A related concept is a <i>specific</i><span style='font-style:normal'> concept, or one that denotes the level of detail beyond which the average lay
        visitor is unlikely to understand or appreciate. Taking another example from
        the location facet, we might mark cities and towns as &lsquo;specific&rsquo;, and then </span><i>hide</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> additional details like archaeological site
        designations from all but museum staff and researchers. </span></li>
    </ol>
      <p>The level of generic and specific concepts varies among
        facets, and is also a function of the audience&rsquo;s point-of-view. However, we
        think that marking these levels in the ontology will provide a valuable tool to
        improve the faceted browser interface, and to allow for effective adaptation to
      different audiences.</p>
      <p>Following the model described in Shaw &amp; Schmitz (2006),
        we plan to use the activity of users in the system to provide additional
        functionality around sets. For example, we can detect when a given set shares
        many objects with other users&rsquo; sets, and can then suggest other objects of
        potential interest (somewhat like collaborative filtering). We can also track
        the community&rsquo;s interest in particular objects or areas of the collections by
        analyzing user activity such as set definition, sharing and viewing, tagging
        activity, etc. Knowing objects and areas of widespread interest, the system can
        recommend areas of exploration to new site visitors, and could inform staff
        priorities for digitization work in the collections. With the right metadata
        and activity-tracking framework in place, these kinds of tools are relatively
      easy to develop.</p>
      <h2>5.2. Deployment Initiatives</h2>
      <p>We are in discussion with other museums about deploying
        Delphi for their collections. There has been some related interest in the
        potential for cross-collection search support. This raises issues of point of
        view: typically, a common (or translated) ontology is used for the combined
        collections.  Alternately, various points of view might be supported by
      indexing a &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; collection using a &lsquo;local&rsquo; ontology. </p>
      <p>Related to this are the issues of ontology reuse, and the
        sharing of common facets. Some facets are more common across disciplines (e.g.,
        location and time), whereas others may be more tied to a given collection. For
        example, technique for anthropology is not the same as for art history, and the
        intersection of culture facets might be very small for collections from quite
      different museums.</p>
      <p>On a practical level, the Delphi team and the OpenCollection
        development team are currently exploring an integration of the two toolkits to
        make it easier for museums to deploy a collections browser based upon their
      CMS.</p>
      <h2>5.3. New Research Initiatives</h2>
      <p>We have described the process of ontology design and
        refinement as a process more than a task, one that benefits from domain
        expertise (e.g., recognizing that when an object has two particular qualities,
        a third quality can be inferred). However, what is lacking is a tool and an
        associated workflow that will simplify this, and make it possible to engage a
        community of people in maintaining the ontology. We have proposed a model for
        community maintenance of curated resources (like ontologies), a model that
        combines many of the qualities of other community production efforts, but is
        adjusted to allow for submissions/suggestions to be vetted by domain experts.
        This allows the process to scale, leveraging a relatively large pool of
        graduate students, academics, and others in a given discipline who can suggest
        additions and improvements. However, by filtering all suggestions through a set
        of experts, the collections managers can still ensure that high quality is
      maintained.</p>
      <p>This model will be supported by a set of -based tools to
        ease the process of submission and review. The tools will also automate the
        integration of changes into the ontology and will update the semantic index
        that supports the collections browser. In addition, the framework will maintain
        metrics for the participants over time to track how often their suggestions are
        judged to be correct, and as well how useful the suggestions prove to be. These
        factors will be combined to rank new suggestions, ensuring that the experts who
        filter suggestions can concentrate on the highest quality suggestions first
      (recognizing that they have limited time for such work). </p>
      <p>We think that such a tool has wide application for ontology
        maintenance, as well as for other curated resources like specialty
      dictionaries, etc.</p>
